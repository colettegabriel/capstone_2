    "In the past, BevCo has maintained a large salesforce and used sales calls as the first contact for potential customers. This practice has been effective but expensive and hard to scale.

Current marketing efforts are divide rougly evenly, with half of initial outreach made through email (n = 21901) and half through direct calls (n = 20584).\n",

    "BevCo currently reaches about 1,825 perspective new customers per month through ongoing email campaigns. In order to test the effectiveness of the new campaign, we propose that 20% of the contacts who would have ordinarily been designated to receive the existing email receive the new email instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Sample Selection and Data Collection</h3> <a name='sample'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first month, the 20% who receive the new email campaign will be decided randomly from our list of all potential contacts in the U.S. After 2 weeks we will review the results of the campaign to get a snapshot of how the new email is performing. This will give the team the chance to check and adjust if any changes need to be made. \n",
    "\n",
    "If results are not statistically significant after the first month, we will continue to run the test in the same manner for an additional month to gather more data. If the test shows signs of success (i.e., being significantly more effective than the original email in achieving sales), we propose to keep the ratio at 20% during an additional month, focusing the new emails more heavily in the territories of Utah and Oregon. In these two regions sales calls outperform emails by the highest rates (16% and 11%), so they will be good places for further testing if inititial improvement is shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Assumptions</h3> <a name='assumptions'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the results of this test to be valid, we assume that potentional new customers receiving this new email would respond in a way similar to customers who have received the existing email in the past. We need to make this assumption because we are looking only at new customers, not repeat business.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate way to test the effectiveness of the new email campaign would be to send a second series of emails to contacts who did not convert after their intial contact. To conduct this test, we would pull a sample of several thousand past contacts from the database and email them again. The division would be the same as for the new potential customers, i.e. 20% would receive the new email and the remaining 80% would receive the old email.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that both of these tests can be run simultaneously and both with provide slightly different data to ascertain the effectiveness of the new email campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What Does Success Look Like?</h3> <a name=\"look_like\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to demonstrate an improved conversion rate for the potential new customers to become buyers. The <b>success metric</b> for this campaign will be the number of emails that result in sales for the new campaign when compared to existing email sales rates. We will rate performance compared with all sales data for the past year and with sales data with Q2 from the past year. We will also break down performance of the new email campaign by sales region to compare on a state by state basis with existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondarily we will continue compare the performance of each email campaign separately to the effectiveness of sales calls. As testing continues, we will outline additional work involving testing the email campaigns with potential customers who were previously reached through sales calls and with calling contacts who did not convert through email campaigns."
