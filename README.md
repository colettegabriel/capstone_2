# Capstone 2: Experimental Design

Proposal 

In the past, BevCo has maintained a large salesforce and used sales calls as the first contact for potential customers.
This practice has been effective but expensive and hard to scale. In recent years, BevCo has tested email marketing and had
some success. Current marketing efforts are divide rougly evenly, with half of initial outreach made through email (n = 21901)
and half through direct calls (n = 20584).

BevCo is anxious to cut cost by reducing sales calls if they can prove that email marketing is at least as effective as their
older, more labor intensive apprach. They have asked Marketing to create a new email campaign to test whether customer
conversion rate can be maintained without the influence of direct sales calls.

About the Dataset 

This sample data set was originally uploaded by Swayanjeet Mishra as a Kaggle test dataset. The focus of the dataset is a
company that sells grocery products wholesale to other suppliers. I chose this dataset for the experimental design capstone
because it contains datapoints for just over 42,000 customers with information on whether they made a purchase after being
contacted by a salesperson vs. contacted through a marketing email.

All sales data is for the U.S., and custoemrs are broken down by state, so we can evaluate the effects of the two marketing
approaches by region as well as more broadly. For the sake of this experimental design, I refer to the company as BevCo
because they mostly sell beverages.
